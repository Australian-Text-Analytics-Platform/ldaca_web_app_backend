"""Self-destruct the backend when its parent process disappears.

Tauri spawns the backend Python process with `LDACA_PARENT_PID` set to the
Tauri PID. This module starts a daemon thread that polls the parent and
exits the backend if the parent goes away — covering cases where neither
Tauri's CloseRequested nor ExitRequested handler fires (force-quit, crash,
kill -9 of the desktop process, etc.).

The detection is deliberately conservative: a single failed probe is NOT
enough to declare the parent dead. We require N consecutive negative
probes, because OpenProcess on Windows can return NULL transiently for
benign reasons (startup races, integrity-level handshake delays, ctypes
HANDLE-truncation quirks). Killing a healthy backend on a flaky probe is
worse than waiting an extra few seconds to notice a real parent death.
