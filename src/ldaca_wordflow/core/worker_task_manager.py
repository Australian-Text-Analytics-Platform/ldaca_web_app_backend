  task state, progress queues, and subscribers must not leak across user workspaces.
- workspace, file, and analysis API routes that submit/cancel/clear worker jobs because

  the Task Center needs one API-visible source of truth for active and historical

    emit bounded SSE events, reconcile futures into ``TaskInfo`` records, cancel or
