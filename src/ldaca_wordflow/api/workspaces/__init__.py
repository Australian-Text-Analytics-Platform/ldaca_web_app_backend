"""Unified workspaces API package.

Exports a single FastAPI `router` that combines core workspace endpoints
(`base.py`) and modular analysis endpoints under `analyses/`.

Used by:
- `main.py` router registration because they need this unit's "Unified workspaces API package" behavior.

Why:
- Keeps workspace endpoint composition centralized.

Flow:
- Create the package-level workspace router consumed by `main.py`.
- Include lifecycle, node, base, analysis, and UI-state subrouters in one place.
- Re-export the workspace manager so existing tests can patch the historical path.
