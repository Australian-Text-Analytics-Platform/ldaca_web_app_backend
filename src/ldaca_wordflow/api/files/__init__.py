"""File management package — aggregate router.

Used by:
- FastAPI router registration in main.py.

Flow:
- ``main.py`` imports ``from .api.files import router as files_router`` and
  mounts it at ``/api``. The top-level ``router`` here carries the ``/files``
  prefix so every sub-router inherits the correct path nesting.
- Each sub-module defines its own ``router = APIRouter()`` with the routes it
  owns. The aggregate router includes them here, preserving URL contract
  compatibility with the original monolithic ``files.py``.
