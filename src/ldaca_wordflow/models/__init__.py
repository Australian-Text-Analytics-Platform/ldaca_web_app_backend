"""Pydantic request/response models for backend API contracts.

Used by:
- API routers and worker result serialization boundaries because they need a backend
  boundary that validates inputs before delegating to workspace or worker state.
Why:
- Centralizes schema contracts shared between frontend and backend endpoints.

Refactor note:
- This module is large and mixes domains (auth/files/workspaces/analysis); future
    split by domain files could improve maintainability and import clarity.
